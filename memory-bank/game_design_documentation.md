# Technical Requirements and Architecture

## Frontend Requirements
### React Application Structure
- **Component-based architecture**: Modular, reusable components
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for complex game state
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety for game mechanics
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live gameplay

### Key Frontend Components
1. **GameRoom**: Main game interface with player boards
2. **PlayerBoard**: Individual player's game sheet and controls
3. **CardDisplay**: Interactive card flipping and selection
4. **ResourceTracker**: Real-time resource management display
5. **WallBuilder**: Interactive wall construction interface
6. **ChatSystem**: In-game communication
7. **GameLobby**: Room creation and joining interface

## Backend Requirements
### Go Application Architecture
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with layers
- **Microservices Ready**: Modular design for future scaling
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time game state synchronization
- **RESTful API**: Standard HTTP endpoints for game management
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL with GORM ORM

### Core Backend Services
1. **Authentication Service**: User registration and login
2. **Game Room Service**: Create, join, and manage game sessions
3. **Game Engine Service**: Core game logic and rule enforcement
4. **Real-time Service**: WebSocket handling and state broadcasting
5. **Persistence Service**: Game state saving and loading
6. **Validation Service**: Game move validation and anti-cheat

## Database Schema Requirements
### Core Entities
- Users (authentication and profiles)
- GameRooms (session management)
- GameStates (current game data)
- PlayerStates (individual player data)
- GameHistory (completed games)
- PlayerActions (move logging)

## Performance Requirements
- **Real-time Latency**: <100ms for game actions
- **Concurrent Games**: Support 100+ simultaneous games
- **Player Capacity**: 1000+ concurrent players
- **Data Persistence**: 99.9% reliability for game states
