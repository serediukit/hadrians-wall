# Current Project Status

## Project State: **INITIAL PLANNING** âœ…

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Project concept definition
- [x] Technology stack selection
- [x] Game mechanics research and documentation
- [x] Architecture planning
- [x] Development roadmap creation
- [x] Memory bank setup

## Current Priority Tasks
1. **Backend Foundation Setup**
   - [ ] Initialize Go project structure
   - [ ] Set up PostgreSQL database
   - [ ] Create basic REST API framework
   - [ ] Implement user authentication

2. **Frontend Foundation Setup**  
   - [ ] Initialize React TypeScript project
   - [ ] Configure Redux Toolkit
   - [ ] Set up routing structure
   - [ ] Create basic layout components

## Next Steps (Week 1)
1. Create Go project with clean architecture
2. Set up database schema and migrations
3. Implement basic user registration/login API
4. Create React project with TypeScript
5. Set up development environment with Docker

## Blockers and Considerations
- None currently identified
- Game rules reference materials needed for detailed implementation
- Consider multiplayer testing strategy early in development

## Technical Decisions Made
- **Backend**: Go with clean architecture pattern
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript and Redux Toolkit
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data
- **Real-time**: WebSockets for game synchronization
- **Deployment**: Docker containers for consistency

## Resources Needed
- Hadrian's Wall rulebook for complete game mechanics
- UI/UX design patterns for board game interfaces
- WebSocket best practices for real-time multiplayer games
