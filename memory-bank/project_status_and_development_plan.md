# Current Project Status

## Project State: **FRONTEND FOUNDATION - IN PROGRESS** ‚ö°

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Project concept definition
- [x] Technology stack selection
- [x] Game mechanics research and documentation
- [x] Architecture planning
- [x] Development roadmap creation
- [x] Memory bank setup
- [x] React TypeScript project initialization
- [x] Redux Toolkit configuration
- [x] Routing structure setup
- [x] HomePage component with authentication forms
- [x] Layout component system
- [x] Authentication UI components (LoginForm, RegisterForm)
- [x] Game introduction component
- [x] Header navigation component
- [x] Tailwind CSS styling implementation

## Current Priority Tasks
1. **Frontend Authentication Integration** üîÑ
    - [ ] Create Auth Redux slice with login/register actions
    - [ ] Implement authentication service layer
    - [ ] Add form validation and error handling
    - [ ] Connect forms to backend API

2. **Core Page Components**
    - [ ] LobbyPage - Game room browser and creation
    - [ ] ProfilePage - User profile management
    - [ ] GamePage - Main game interface (placeholder)
    - [ ] Footer component

3. **Backend Foundation Setup**
    - [ ] Initialize Go project structure
    - [ ] Set up PostgreSQL database
    - [ ] Create basic REST API framework
    - [ ] Implement user authentication endpoints

## Recently Completed (Latest Session)
### Frontend Components Implemented:
- **HomePage**: Complete landing page with login/register functionality
- **GameIntro**: Attractive game introduction with feature highlights
- **LoginForm**: Form validation with email/password fields
- **RegisterForm**: Registration with username, email, password confirmation
- **Layout**: App wrapper with conditional header/footer display
- **Header**: Navigation bar for authenticated users with logout functionality

### Technical Implementation Details:
- Used React Hook Form for form handling and validation
- Implemented Redux integration patterns (ready for auth slice)
- Applied Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive design
- Created TypeScript interfaces and proper component structure
- Added loading states and error handling UI patterns

## Next Steps (Current Sprint)
1. **Create Auth Redux Slice** - loginUser, registerUser, logoutUser actions
2. **Implement API Service Layer** - HTTP client for authentication endpoints
3. **Build LobbyPage** - Game room creation and browsing interface
4. **Add TypeScript Types** - User, Game, Room interfaces
5. **Connect to Backend** - Integrate authentication with Go API

## Blockers and Considerations
- Auth Redux slice needed before authentication forms are functional
- Backend API endpoints required for complete authentication flow
- Game room state management design needed for LobbyPage
- WebSocket integration planning for real-time features

## Technical Decisions Made
- **Backend**: Go with clean architecture pattern
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript and Redux Toolkit ‚úÖ
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data
- **Real-time**: WebSockets for game synchronization
- **Deployment**: Docker containers for consistency
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS for styling ‚úÖ
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with validation ‚úÖ
- **Component Structure**: Feature-based organization ‚úÖ

## Development Progress Metrics
- **Frontend Setup**: 70% Complete
    - ‚úÖ Project structure and dependencies
    - ‚úÖ Core page routing
    - ‚úÖ Authentication UI components
    - ‚úÖ Layout and navigation
    - ‚è≥ Redux state management (auth slice pending)
    - ‚è≥ API service integration

- **Backend Setup**: 0% Complete
    - ‚è≥ All backend tasks pending

## Resources Needed
- Hadrian's Wall rulebook for complete game mechanics
- UI/UX design patterns for board game interfaces
- WebSocket best practices for real-time multiplayer games
- Backend API design for game state management

## Code Quality Standards Established
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Component-based architecture with proper separation
- Form validation with user-friendly error messages
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Loading states and error handling patterns
- Clean code practices with proper naming conventions
